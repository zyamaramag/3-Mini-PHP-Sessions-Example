Session Examples Project
By: Gadiel Zya T. Maramag - BSIT3 B1

----------------------------------------
Project Description:
This project demonstrates three mini examples of using PHP sessions. 
Sessions allow PHP to store temporary user data across multiple pages. 
These examples show practical uses of sessions, including activity tracking, quiz scoring, and page visit counting.

----------------------------------------
How Each Example Works:

1. Activity Timer:
   - Automatically starts a timer using a session variable.
   - Displays the elapsed time in seconds.
   - Restart Timer button resets the session start time.

2. Quiz Score Tracker:
   - Multi-page quiz example using HTML forms.
   - Stores score in a session variable across pages.
   - Calculates total score and shows Pass/Fail.

3. Page Visit Counter:
   - Counts how many times the user has visited the page in the current session.
   - Stores the count in a session variable.
   - Reset button clears the counter.

----------------------------------------
Practical Applications:
- Tracking user activity or time spent on a page.
- Storing quiz or survey scores across multiple pages.
- Counting page visits, user actions, or session-based analytics.

Notes:
- Make sure cookies are enabled in the browser because PHP sessions rely on them.
- Sessions are temporary and expire when the browser is closed or the session times out.
